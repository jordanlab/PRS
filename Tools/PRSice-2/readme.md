# PRSice-2

PRSice-2 is a clumping and thresholding-based tool used for calculating Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) across a range of p-value thresholds. 

In this project, PRSice-2 was applied to the **UK Biobank** dataset to:
- Benchmark PRS results alongside `pgsc_calc` and `PRScs`
- Generate scores across multiple p-value thresholds
