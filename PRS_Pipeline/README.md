#  Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) Pipeline  ![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-in%20progress-yellow)

This repository contains a reproducible pipeline for computing and validating Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) using diverse genomic cohorts, including:

- **UK Biobank**
- **All of Us Research Program**
- **Lyday dataset (VCF-based input)**

The pipeline is built using:
- Python CLI (with support for interactive inputs and `config.yaml`)
- Nextflow (`pgsc_calc` integration)
- R and Python for statistical validation

## Repo Structure

| Folder / File      | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `steps/`           | Python step-wise modules: `preprocess`, `run_pgsc_calc`, and `validate` |
| `main.py`          | Entry-point CLI script to run any step interactively |
| `config.yaml`      | User-editable configuration |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
